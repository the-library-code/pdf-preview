# PDF Preview

This is an addition to [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org) (on github [@DSpace/DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace)) to add a button that previews a PDF within the browser. The preview currently opens up as modal dialog, but could also be embeded into the item view directly. It currently supports DSpace's JSPUI in version 6.3 only, but it should be simple to port to XMLUI or future versions of DSpace 6. If you need help porting it, please don't hesitate to contact [The Library Code](https://www.the-library-code.de).
