# PDF Preview
This extension to DSpace was developped by [The Library Code GmbH](https://www.the-library-code.de) with the support of [Leibniz Institute for Psychology Information (ZPID)](https://leibniz-psychology.org).

If an item contains a PDF file, instead of the common "Open" button, a button "Preview" and a button "Download" will be shown. The button "Preview" opens a modal dialog  within the user's browser previewing the PDF using Mozilla's phantastic [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). The buttown "Download" downloads the PDF regularly. This enables users to see any PDF's content easily without having to download the whole file and without using a PDF viewer.

This extension could be easily changed to show and embeded PDF preview directly in the item view instead of just offering a button to open the preview.

# Installation

# Configuration
